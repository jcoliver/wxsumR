#' Longest interval of consecutive dry days
#'
#' @description Determines the longest interval of consecutive days that are
#' considered "dry". Values of \code{x} that are less than \code{rain_cutoff}
#' are categorized as dry.
#'
#' @details Missing values are not simply removed for purpose of calculation.
#' If \code{x} includes \code{NA} values and \code{na.rm = FALSE}, \code{NA} is
#' returned. However, when \code{x} includes \code{NA} values and
#' \code{na.rm = TRUE}, special consideration is required. In contrast with
#' other methods, \code{NA} cannot be dropped without significant implications
#' on calculations. Consider a vector of \code{c(0, 0, NA, 0)}. If \code{NA}
#' values are removed, the vector reduces to \code{c(0, 0, 0)} and the longest
#' consectutive stretch of dry days becomes 3. This is not an accurate
#' representation of the data. Instead, when \code{na.rm = TRUE}, vectors with
#' \code{NA} values will evaluate missing values as non-dry days. In the
#' example above, this results in the longest dry interval being 2. This
#' provides a more accurate representation of dry day intervals based on
#' non-missing data.
#'
#' @param x           numeric vector of rainfall measurements
#' @param rain_cutoff minimum amount of rainfall to count as non-dry day
#' @param period      period to measure longest dry spell; see \code{value}
#' @param na.rm       logical indicating treatment of \code{NA} values; by
#' default, \code{na.rm = TRUE}, \code{NA} values are ignored. If set to
#' \code{FALSE}, any \code{NA} values in \code{x} will result in a return value
#' of \code{NA}
#'
#' @return numeric vector of length 1 with the number of days that have rainfall
#' less than \code{rain_cutoff}; value returned is determined by value of
#' \code{period}:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{start}{number of consecutive days at beginning of season with less
#'   than \code{rain_cutoff} of measured rain; if first day of season had
#'   rainfall greater than or equal to \code{rain_cutoff}, the returned value
#'   will be zero}
#'   \item{mid}{longest stretch of days with less than \code{rain_cutoff}
#'   contained within the period; if rainfall was less than \code{rain_cutoff}
#'   for every day in defined season, the returned value will be zero}
#'   \item{end}{number of consecutive days at end of season with less
#'   than \code{rain_cutoff} of measured rain; if last day of season had
#'   rainfall greater than or equal to \code{rain_cutoff}, the returned value
#'   will be zero}
