#' Enumerate seasons in data frame
#'
#' @description \code{enumerate_seasons} categorizes rows by an annual season
#' defined by \code{start_*} and \code{end_*} parameters. The resulting object
#' includes a \code{season_year} column indicating which season the date is
#' considered part of. This is generally only used for internal data
#' processing by \code{summarize_*} functions.
#'
#' @param data         long-format data frame with weather data including a
#' column \code{date}; ideally the data object is the result of a call to
#' \code{\link{to_long}}
#' @param start_month  numeric starting month defining season (inclusive)
#' @param end_month    numeric ending month defining season (inclusive)
#' @param start_day    numeric day of starting month defining season
#' (inclusive); defaults to 15
#' @param end_day      numeric day of ending month defining season (inclusive);
#' defaults to \code{start_day}
#'
#' @return A copy of the passed \code{data} data frame with an additional
#' column, \code{season_year} indicating the year of the season that the
#' observation "belongs" to. For seasons that \emph{do not} cross the new year,
#' this is simply the year the observation was made. For seasons that \emph{do}
#' include the new year (e.g. a season starts in November and ends in the
#' subsequent March), \code{season_year} is defined as the year in which the
#' season starts. That is, for a season spanning November through March, the
#' value of \code{season_year} for observations in January, February, and March
#' is the prior year (e.g. \code{season_year} for an observation on 1983-02-01
#' for a season spanning November through March would be 1984).
