# Preamble

The wxsumR package provides functions to calculate annual summary statistics 
for rainfall and temperature data. The specifics of each statistic can be found 
in the documentation for specific functions. All calculations are performed on 
a per-site, per-season basis. This vignette provides an introduction on their 
use and the expectations of input data.

Functions and data in the wxsumR package can be made available through the 
`library` command:

```{r load-package}
library(wxsumR)
```

The package includes both serial and parallel implementations, the latter being 
wrappers for the former that use functions from the parallel package. For 
smaller data sets (i.e. 150,000 cells of data or fewer), a serial 
implementation will likely work fine on a modern laptop. For larger data sets, 
consider the parallel implementations (functions that begin with `par_`) or, 
for _really_ big data sets, parallel implementations on high-performance 
computer clusters may be the optimal solution.

## Input data

The wxsumR functions take a data frame with two types of data:

1. A single column with a unique identifier for the site where weather 
measurements were taken; this column can be type numeric, character, or factor.
2. All remaining columns are measurements for _either_ rainfall or temperature. 
Given separate functions for rainfall and temperature, avoid sending the wrong 
weather data to functions (i.e. do not pass a data frame with rainfall 
measurements to `summarize_temperature`).

The names of the columns in point 2 above must be in a specific format: \<measurement\>\_YYYYMMDD. That is, each column name should be prefixed with a 
character string indicating what was measured (e.g. "rf" for rainfall, "tmp" 
for temperature), followed by an underscore, "\_", followed by the date in 
YYYYMMDD format.

### Rainfall

The included data set, `rain_2yr`, has two years of rainfall data for six 
sites. If we look at the first four columns of data, we see:

```{r}
rain_2yr[, 1:4]
```

The first column, `r colnames(rain_2yr)[1]`, contains the unique identifier for 
each site. The remaining columns show daily measurements of rainfall. Note the 
format of column names for those columns with rainfall data (columns 2 through 
`r ncol(rain_2yr)`): `r colnames(rain_2yr)[2]` shows the format 
\<measurement\>\_YYYYMMDD as described above.

### Temperature

The included data set, `temperature_2yr`, has two years of temperature data for 
six sites. If we look at the first four columns of data, we see:

```{r}
temperature_2yr[, 1:4]
```

The first column, `r colnames(temperature_2yr)[1]`, contains the unique 
identifier for each site. The remaining columns show daily measurements of 
temperature. Note the format of column names for those columns with temperature 
data (columns 2 through `r ncol(temperature_2yr)`): 
`r colnames(temperature_2yr)[2]` shows the format \<measurement\>\_YYYYMMDD as 
described above.

# Serial implementations

## `summarize_rainfall`

The bare minimum of information for calculating rainfall summary statistics is:

+ A data frame with daily rainfall data, as described in [Input data](#input-data)
+ The month in which the user-defined season starts
+ The month in which the user-defined season ends

By default, seasons start and end on the fifteenth day of the month, but this 
can be changed through the `start_day` and `end_day` parameters, respectively. 
If only the `start_day` parameter is specified, the same value will be used for 
`end_day`. Users should be cautious when specifiying days at the end of the 
month, given variation among months in which day is the last day of the month 
(28, 29, 30, 31).

In the example above, we calculate summary statistics for the two-year data 
set, with the season starting on 15 March and ending on 15 November.

```{r rain-serial}
rain_summary <- summarize_rainfall(rain = rain_2yr, 
                                   start_month = 3,
                                   end_month = 11)
```

By default, the output of `summarize_rainfall` is wide-formatted, with each 
column corresponding to an individual statistic (such as mean, median, and 
standard deviation) for a single season (year). The first four columns of data 
illustrate this:

```{r rain-wide-output}
rain_summary[, 1:4]
```

The first column, `r colnames(rain_summary)[1]` is the unique id for site, as 
we saw in the original data. The next three columns show the mean, median, and 
standard deviations, respectively, for each site in the 
`r substr(x = colnames(rain_summary)[2], start = 13, stop = 16)` season.

If you prefer the output in longer format, where values for individual seasons 
(year) are distributed across rows instead of columns, pass `wide = FALSE` to
`summarize_rainfall`:

```{r rain-long}
long_rain_summary <- summarize_rainfall(rain = rain_2yr, 
                                        start_month = 3,
                                        end_month = 11,
                                        wide = FALSE)
```

The resultant output now has column names corresponding to the statistic only, 
and values for different seasons are shown in different rows.

```{r rain-long-output}
long_rain_summary[, 1:5]
```

## `summarize_temperature`

`summarize_temperature` works in the same way as `summarize_rainfall` and has 
the same minimum requirements for what is required in the function call:

+ A data frame with daily temperature data, as described in [Input data](#input-data)
+ The month in which the user-defined season starts
+ The month in which the user-defined season ends

```{r temperature-serial}
temperature_summary <- summarize_temperature(temperature = temperature_2yr, 
                                             start_month = 3,
                                             end_month = 11)
```

By default, the output is in wide format, with statistics for different seasons 
(years) spread across columns:

```{r temperature-wide-output}
temperature_summary[, 1:4]
```

Passing `wide = FALSE` to `summarize_temperature` will result in 
longer-formatted output, where the measurements for different seasons (years) 
are distributed among rows instead of columns:

```{r temperature-long}
long_temperature_summary <- summarize_temperature(temperature = temperature_2yr, 
                                                  start_month = 3,
                                                  end_month = 11,
                                                  wide = FALSE)
long_temperature_summary[, 1:5]
```

# Parallel implementations

Parallel implementations of the two summarize functions use the parallel 
package to distribute calculations among multiple processors on your machine. 
Because calculations are performed for individual sites and thus independent of 
one another, this "embarrassingly parallel" computation lends itself well to 
the `parLapply` function in the parallel package. But you don't really need to 
worry about any of that, because the parallel implementations manage the 
distribution of calculations to multiple processors.

Note that if you have a fairly large data set (like over one million cells), 
the parallel implementation may still present computational challenges. This is 
because R will attempt to use as much RAM as is available as it needs it. So 
even though the processing is distributed among processors, there is still a 
limited amount of RAM on the machine you are using. If you find that the 
parallel implementations are crashing your machine (or making it so slow as to 
be unuseable), consider running these calculations on a high-performance 
computer cluster. An alternative solution, which comes with no guarantees, is 
offered at the end of the document.

## `par_summarize_rainfall`

The call to `par_summarize_rainfall` echoes what we saw with 
`summarize_rainfall`:

```{r rain-parallel, eval = FALSE}
par_rain_summary <- par_summarize_rainfall(rain = rain_2yr, 
                                           start_month = 3,
                                           end_month = 11)
```

```{r rain-parallel-run, echo = FALSE}
# We have to restrict example to only two cores in order to pass checks
par_rain_summary <- par_summarize_rainfall(rain = rain_2yr, 
                                           start_month = 3,
                                           end_month = 11,
                                           num_cores = 2)
```

Note the documentation for `par_summarize_rainfall` does not mention the 
`start_month` and `end_month` arguments, but these are ultimately passed to
`summarize_rainfall` (which `par_summarize_rainfall` is calling internally) 
through the dot dot dot (`...`) notation.

A quick glance comparing the first columns of output from the serial and 
parallel implementations shows the results are identical.

```{r compare-rain-out}
rain_summary[, 1:2]
par_rain_summary[, 1:2]
```

To have the output in longer format, pass `wide = FALSE`, just as we did with
`summarize_rainfall`:

```{r rain-parallel-long, eval = FALSE}
long_par_rain_summary <- par_summarize_rainfall(rain = rain_2yr, 
                                           start_month = 3,
                                           end_month = 11,
                                           wide = FALSE)
```

## `par_summarize_temperature`

At this point, it should come as no surprise that the parallel implementation 
for calculations on temperature data work much the same as for the serial 
implementation:

```{r temperature-parallel, eval = FALSE}
par_temperature_summary <- par_summarize_temperature(temperature = temperature_2yr, 
                                                     start_month = 3,
                                                     end_month = 11)
```

```{r temperature-parallel-run, echo = FALSE}
# We have to restrict example to only two cores in order to pass checks
par_temperature_summary <- par_summarize_temperature(temperature = temperature_2yr, 
                                                     start_month = 3,
                                                     end_month = 11,
                                                     num_cores = 2)
```

And if you prefer longer formatted output, where different seasons (years) are 
distributed among rows, pass `wide = FALSE`:

```{r temperature-parallel-long, eval = FALSE}
long_par_temperature_summary <- par_summarize_temperature(temperature = temperature_2yr, 
                                                          start_month = 3,
                                                          end_month = 11,
                                                          wide = FALSE)
```


# Large data, small RAM

_I have a large data set, but I don't have much computer memory, and I don't have access to an HPC._

## One solution, using the serial approach

OK, this is possible, but it is slow. Very. Slow. The basic approach is to 
calculate summary statistics one-by-one on each row (site) of data, and add the 
output to a data frame that you create beforehand. 

```{r avoid-ram-gobbling, eval = FALSE}
# Read a large data file into memory
# E.g. 3,000 sites (rows) of 13,000 daily rainfall measurements (columns)
infile <- "data/rainfall-data.csv"
large_rain <- readr::read_csv(infile)

# This will ultimately become a data frame with results
rain_summary <- NULL

# The months that define the start and end of the season
season_start_month <- 3
season_end_month <- 11

for (i in 1:nrow(large_rain)) {
  # This conditional provides a little reporting message the prints on every 
  # hundredth row
  if (i %% 100 == 0) {
    message(paste0("At row ", i))
  }
  if (i == 1) {
    # Need to set up the output data frame, with the right number of rows
    # Begin by assigning the output of summarize_rainfall based on a single 
    # row (in this case, the first row)
    rain_summary <- summarize_rainfall(rain = large_rain[i, ],
                                    start_month = season_start_month,
                                    end_month = season_end_month)
    # rain_summary now has one row and the appropriate number of columns; we 
    # create empty rows in the data frame to avoid growing the results on each 
    # iteration of the for loop
    rain_summary[2:nrow(large_rain), ] <- NA
  } else {
    # For rows (sites) 2 and up, we can add the output of summarize_rainfall to 
    # the appropriate row in rain_summary
    rain_summary[i, ] <- summarize_rainfall(rain = large_rain[i, ],
                                            start_month = season_start_month,
                                            end_month = season_end_month)
  }
}
```

A couple of caveats are warranted:

+ This implementation assumes wide-formatted data is the desired output format. 
If you want long-formatted data, this will _not_ work as written. You'll need 
to get creative in the creation and subsequent updating of the data frame 
holding the results (`rain_summary`). Why? The wide-formatted output will 
create exactly one row of summary statistics for each row of the input data 
(so, in this case, `nrow(large_rain) = nrow(rain_summary)`). This is not true 
for longer formatted data, because for each row of the input data, it will 
produce a separate row of summary statistics calculated for each year (season). 
So if your input file has 3 years of data, the number of rows of output will be 
three times the number of rows of the input. For example, if you have 100 sites 
(rows) of input data that covers three seasons (years) and pass `wide = FALSE` 
to `summarize_rainfall`, the resulting output will have 300 rows of summary 
statistics.
+ This could be made a little more creative, where individual sites are farmed 
out to different processors, in a para-parallel approach. Check out the source 
code for the parallel implementations (`par_summarize_rainfall` and
`par_summarize_temperature`) for ideas on using the parallel package.
+ This approach, and caveats, also apply to `summarize_temperature`.
